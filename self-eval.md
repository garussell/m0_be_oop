# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
### I utilized everyting that was available to me, including my peers, study-hall, and researching items not covered in the lecture.  I think I did pretty well, however was not totally satisfied with the Hobbit.  I'm actually at the very end of the day and really should eat dinner.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
### I think I'm focused and actually could use a longer break, especially around lunch time.  I've been working through lunch, but I am eating so thats good.

- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?
### I learned to just go one line at a time and test it to make sure each line I write works before moving on.  That was a tip from Aurora in study hall.  I did already write several lines of code before coming to that realization.  I'm excited to try that strategy out.
